Instead, forecasters typically analyze streamlines that depict wind flow. These are useful because they show where surface air converges and diverges. |

The eyewall is adjacent to the eye and is a ring of intense thunderstorms that whirl around the storm’s center.

The sinking air warms and creates an inversion above the surface known as the trade wind inversion that, when strong enough, can inhibit formation of intense thunderstorms and hurricanes. |

However, there are many differences between these two storm systems. A hurricane derives its energy from the warm water and the latent heat of condensation, whereas a mid-latitude storm derives its energy from horizontal temperature contrasts. The vertical structure of a hurricane is such that its central column of air is warm from the surface upward (, they are warm-core lows). A hurricane weakens with height. Mid-latitude cyclones, however, are cold-core lows that usually intensify with increasing height. A hurricane usually contains an eye where the air is sinking, while mid-latitude cyclones are characterized by centers of rising air. Hurricane winds are strongest near the surface, whereas the strongest winds of the mid-latitude cyclones are found aloft in the jet stream. Even though hurricanes weaken rapidly as they move inland, their circulation may draw in air with contrasting properties and if the hurricane links with an upper-level trough, it may actually become a mid-latitude cyclone. |

Hurricanes are fueled by warm tropical water – the warmer the water, the more fuel available to drive the storm. An increase of only ;C (1°F) can increase sea-surface temperature, which can in turn increase the maximum winds of hurricanes by about 5 knots (almost 6 miles/hr). Sea-surface temperatures have increased across the tropical North Atlantic since the mid-1990s. At least some of this warming may be attributed to an overall temperature rise throughout the world’s oceans. Climate models predict that, as the world continues to warm, sea-surface temperatures in the tropics will continue to rise, even by about 2°C (;F) by the end of this century. Should these predictions prove correct, future hurricanes could have much more intense wind speeds. There is debate, however, whether hurricanes will be more frequent. |

The flooding is due, in part, to winds pushing water onto the shore and to the heavy rains. The combined effect of high water, which is usually well above the high-tide level, high winds, and the Ekman transport (bending or movement of water influenced by the surface winds), produces an abnormal rise of several meters in the ocean level that can inundate low-lying areas. Extreme flooding can even occur with relatively weak storms. Hurricane-spawned tornadoes can also cause considerable damage. |

The answer may also include a description of the path Sandy followed and include the other nations that were touched. In addition, answers may mention that in the aftermath of Sandy, the National Hurricane Center changed its policy so that hurricane warnings can now be issued and kept in place up to landfall even if a hurricane is expected to become a post-tropical cyclone (, no longer technically a hurricane) before it strikes land because coastal residents were not placed under a hurricane warning for Sandy. |

Recent mathematical studies have shown that ocean spray has an effect on the winds of a hurricane. Apparently, the tiny spray reduces the friction between the wind and sea surface. Therefore, with the same pressure gradient, the more ocean spray, the higher the winds. So, limiting ocean spray from entering the air above by dropping oil onto the ocean water may reduce the storm’s winds. Without knowing the mathematical reasons, the ancient sailors, by dumping oil into the sea, may have actually been preventing very strong winds and even hurricanes. |
